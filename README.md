# 4Chan-Downloader
does the thing

Look, it downloads imgs from 4chan,
will add video downloading soon / if people request it. 

java so should run on most platforms. put in a request for features or anything else. 

Click search to locate a folder for downloading ( or copy and paste the filepath )
then paste your url and click start at the bottom.
easy, quick, and writes files to disk instead of storing in memory.
